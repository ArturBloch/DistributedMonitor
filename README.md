# DistributedMonitor
DistributedMonitor using Ricard - Agrawala algorithm

# Build
Build the solution in Visual Studio (tested on VS2019). 

# Run

After building the solution you can run the program from Visual Studio or project \x64\Debug directory.  
Running the program equals 1 instance of a "Site" in Ricard-Agrawala algorithm.  
run with either $DistributedMonitor run ownPort  
but then you have to connect to each other Site individually  
OR run with $DistributedMonitor run ownPort port1 port2 port3 etc.. list of ports of other Sites  

# After running
You can run tests on each "Site" by typing
"TESTA"
"TESTB"
"TESTC"
